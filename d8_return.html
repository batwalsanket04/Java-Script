    Return keyword


    When we calculate any value inside a function, it stays valid only until the function is being called
    The moment function call ends, the values inside function lose their existance.
    If we want to use any value from inside the function on the outside, we won't be able to do that.
    For this, return keyword is useful.
    Using return keyword, we can send a value from within the function to the outside of function.
    This value can be stored in a variable or displayed directly.
    Using this return keyword, we can use our function to calculate values and use them anywhere as per 
    the requirement

    The function execution stops where return keyword is used.
    For this, always make sure to use return keyword at the end of the function.

      function add() {
        const sum = 30 + 5;
        // console.log(sum);

        return sum;
        console.log("This is printed after return keyword");
      }

      //   add();
      console.log(add());

      let addition = add();

      console.log("The addition is " + addition);

      //   console.log(sum);
