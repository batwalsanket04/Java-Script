    Way to write functions in js

    1.named functions/normal function:
            -this is common way to write a function.
            -we write a function using 'function' keyword and we call its using the name assigned to the function.
            -The named function are hoisted i.e they can be called even before declaring them.

    2.variable named function /varible expression:-
           -In This type ,we create a normal function and store it in variable.
           for calling this function ,we need to call the variable .if we call the stored function ,it gives error
           the variable named function are not hoisted.


    3.anonymous function:
          It is somewhat similar to variable named function ,only the diffrance is that the function
          stored in the variable does not have any name.
   
    4.SELF/INVOKING function:
        -this is  a type of function which call itself automatically after it is declared.
        It is written like an anonymous function but it is written in '()' without storing  in any varible 
        this type of function are used to perform some action as soon as page is looked..

    5.arrow function/lambda funtion/fat:
        -It is function from modern Js(ES6)
        -It replace various types of function espacially anonymouse function.
        -it is not involve writting the function keyword ,instead ,it directly uses the '(),''=>' and '{}'rules 
        for writting the '{}' in arrow function.
        1.it does not need the '{}'the code block is of one life.
        2.if the code is of multiple lines or if the single code has return keyword ,then the '{}' are mendatory

    <script>
        //named function /normal function
        function demo(){
            console.log("This is printed using Normal Function" );
        }
        demo();

   // variable name function

   let myFun=function demo1(){

    console.log("this is printed in variable name function");

   };

   myFun();
   //demo();//gives error
   



   //Anonymous function


   let myFun2=function(){
    console.log("this is printed using Anonymous function");
   };
    myFun2();


    //self invoking function

    //NO NEED TO CALL WITH FUNCTION.IT CALL ITSELF AUTOMATICALLY

    (function(){
        console.log("this is self invoking function");
    })();


    //Arrow Function

    // if the code is multiline when {} is mendatoryyy.

    let myFun3=()=>
        console.log(`this is printed using arrow function`);

    myFun3();
    myFun3();
    myFun3();
    myFun3();
    myFun3();


    // if thwe code is single line but has return keyword the '{}' are mendatoryyy.
    
    let myfun3=()=>{
        return "hello";
    }
        console.log(myfun3());
