    <!-- way to diplay the string and variables together in js

 1.use of multiple document.write():-Becouse this approach ,we need to write the multiple line of code just to get
                                     a  simple output with multiple variables in it.
                                    -simple output with multiple variable.


 2.use of concatination symbol(+):- thois method helps to write our output in single line but in this we need ton use multiple inverted Quates and Quancatination operator 
                                   -Even if we miss any quates or operator our entire output can go wrong.

 3.template literal:- It is the feature of modern Java script (ES6) to writes output.
                    -if we works concatination operator we can finds problem while using single quates and double quates 
                    -also we need to  pay proper attention  to use the concatination operator for writting variables
                    -by using template litaral all of the above problem aare solved using the (``)(bluctick) symbol.
                    -the  output that we want to display is written in these backtick symbol and the variable are written int the ($var_name)
                    -also we can easily write the quates symbol inside the backticks 
                    -the template literal makes our job of writing symbol and varible make much easiar.
                    
                
                                   -->

    <script>

       let name=prompt("enter yor name");
       let age= +prompt("enter your age");
       
    document.write("<h1> hello");
    document.write(name);
    document.write("! Good Morning! <br>");
    document.write("yoyr are ");
    document.write(age);

    document.write("years old. </h1>");


// concatenation operator

    document.write(
        "<h1> Hello " + name +"  you are " + age +"  years old</h1>"
    )

// template literal

let a = 10, b = 20;
console.log(`Sum is ${a + b}`);  // Output: Sum is 30
