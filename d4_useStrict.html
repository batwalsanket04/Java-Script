    <!-- 
    
    use strict

    It is a rule/pragma which tells our browser how to execute the javascript code.
    It puts our browser on 'strict mode'
    Because of this, the use of undeclared variables is prevented.

    This helps the developer to write cleaner codes which will be better for execution and for troubleshooting
    
    'use strict' can be used in blockn scope as well as on the global scope.
    -->
    <script>
      "use strict"; //Global scope strict mode

      //   let e2;
      e1 = "Javascript"; //This will give error because 'use strict' does not allow usage of undeclared variables.
      console.log(e1);

      e2 = "Another undeclared variable";//This will also give error because 'use strict' does not allow usage of undeclared variables.
      console.log(e2);

      var e1; //The code will give error when we comment this decalration. Because 'use strict' will not allow usage of un-declared variables.
      console.log("My code ended here!");
