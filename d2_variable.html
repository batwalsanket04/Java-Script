    <!-- This Is All About The Variables


      Rules Of  To create The Variable:-


      -We Cant Add The Number Before varible name.
         Ex.  var 1num=10; 
        
      -We Cant Use Any Symbol Starting of the variable ignoring "$" And "_".
         Ex. var #num2=12;  Not Allows
             var $Num2=100;  It Allow
    
     -Js Script Or Any other Lang.Not Allowed To Create variable using Only Number.
         Ex.var 124=1111;

      -Space Is Also Not Allowed In Between The Two Connected Name during Varible Declaration.
      -we can joind Thw Two Words during The Varible declarion using "$","_".

        Ex.var total student=100; not Allow
           Var total_student=100; Allow
           var $totalstud=12; allows

     console.log(num2+40);//  140  we will get Answer.


    // var 1mynum=100;
    // console.log(1mynum);// will get ERROR as per the declartion rule.


    var mynum1=50;
    console.log(mynum1);
