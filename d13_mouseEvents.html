    Events

    The actions that are performed on a website using the inputs devices(mouse, keyboard), window or forms
    are called events

    Javascript is an event driven language, i.e. it can respond to these actions by performing some or 
    other task

    'on' is a prefix used while writing the event.

    In JS, we get four types of events:

    1. Mouse events
    2. Keyboard events
    3. Window events
    4. Form events


    Mouse events

    The actions performed using the mouse are called mouse events.

    1. onclick: This event occurs when we click the left mouse button
    2. ondblclick: This event occurs when we double click the left mouse button 
    3. oncontextmenu: This event occurs when the mouse right button is clicked
    4. onmouseover: This event occurs when the mouse pointer enters the element area
    5. onmouseout: This event occurs when the mouse pointer leaves the element area.
    6. onmousewheel: This event occurs when the mouse scroll wheel has been rotated
    7. onmousedown: This event occurs when any mouse button is pressed down
    8. onmouseup: THis event occurs when any mouse button that has been pressed in is left.

    The below events should be written in the tag body. They are kept outside to 
    prevent confusion in mousedown and mouseup
