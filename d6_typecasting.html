    it is the process of converting from one form into another .
    it is required so that we can use data appropriatly.

    
    1.Modifying with prompt:-
     - we add the "+" as prefix to the prompt method .it convert the data in prompt to a number.
     -prompt gives a string by defoult.


    2.Number();
     -this method helps to us convert our string into number including the decimal value becouse of this method .we can converts the decimal string into decimal decimal string.

    3.ParseInt();
    -this method helps to convert our string into a number while igniring decimal values.
    -the methods stop the conversion of the string as soon as it finds any non-numeric character.

    <script>
 
 let num1= +prompt("Enter the first number");
 let num2= +prompt("enter The second number");

 console.log( num1+ " is of type " + typeof num1);
 console.log( num2+ " is of type " + typeof num2);


 //Number

 let mynum1=number(num1);
 let mynum2=number(num2);

 console.log(mynum1 + " is of type "  +typeof mynum1);
 console.log(mynum2 + " is of type "  +typeof mynum2);

 console.log(mynum1+mynum2);


 //ParseInt()


 let my1=parseInt(num1);
 let my2=parseInt(num2);

 console.log(my1 + " is of type "  +typeof my1);
 console.log(my2 + " is of type "  +typeof my2);

 console.log(my1+my2);//gives us approximate value as output.
