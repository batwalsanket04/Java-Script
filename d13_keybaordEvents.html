    Keybaord events


    1. onkeypress: This event occurs when we press any printable key on the keyboard 
                    (alphabets, symbols, space, enter, etc). This is deprecated event, 
                    instead of this we use keydown event

    2. onkeydown: This event occurs when any key of the keyboard is pressed.
                  This event is now used to identify the key combination in various platforms

    3. onkeyup: This event occurs when any keyboard key that has been pressed in is un-pressed
