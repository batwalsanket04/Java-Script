    Object

    It is one of the most fundamental concepts in JS
    Objects are the enitites which are used to store very large amounts of data.
    They have no limitation on the data storage, i.e. we can store any amount and any kind of data in them.
    The data stored within an object is individaully identified by referring to its 'key'
    This is called key-indexing.

    ***************************************************
    Ways to create object:

    1. Literal method: We simply create a variable and store an object in the variable.
                       This method is useful to create standalone objects.

    2. Instance method: This method is used to create an object using "new" keyword and then
                        store the data in the object.
                        This method can be used on other datatypes as well to create their objects.
                        This method is useful while creating multiple objects.

    3. Constructor method: In this we use a constructor to create multiple objects of similar type.
                           Constructor is a speacial type of function which is used to intialize 
                           values to an object.
                           This constructor is useful when we want to create multiple instances of same object type.
