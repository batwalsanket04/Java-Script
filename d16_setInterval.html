    Asynchronous Behaviour:

    Js is single threaded lang .and thats why it work in synchronous manner.
    It means that the code will get executed line by line from top to the bottom.
    In this case the function wich takes time to execute makes others function wait for thair turn.
    to avoid this asynchrpunous behaviou is implemented.
    In asynchronous Js can hold or block any function can take timr ans allow other fucntion to perform their execution.

    becouse of this time taking function can perform in thier own time while the other function carry out thoier work.





    This asynchronous behaviour can be implemanetd using:

    1callback
    2.asynch and await
    3.promises
    4.setInterval
    5setTimeout

    ****************************************************************************

    setInterval:This method takes two Argument,i.e callback function and time interval in milliseconds
                It executes the given callback fucntion  repeatetly after the given interval.
                If thier is any function performing its task ,it will continue its work without being intruppted by this setInterval.

                this is how setInterval will performn its task asyncrounously.

    
    setTimeout(callback,time_interval):This method also takwe s two argument i.e

    <script>
        let timenow=new Date();

        function greet()
        {
            console.log( "hello the time is:"+timenow.toLocaleTimeString());

        }
       let si1= setInterval(greet,2000);

        let si2= setInterval(()=>{
            console.log("this is executed simulteniously");
        },2000);



        function stop(){

            clearInterval(si1);
            clearInterval(si2);

        }

        let cnt=0;
        let si1=setInterval(()=>{
            cnt++;
            console.log(cnt);
        })
        


            </script>
