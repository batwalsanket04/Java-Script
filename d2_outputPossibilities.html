    Output possibilities


    1. console.log: It is used to display the output in the console of the browser.

    2. alert: This is used to display the output in a separate pop up box on the browser.
              It does not require us to open the console like in previous method.

            The disadvantage for alert is that it halts the execution of the program 
            until the confirmation of alert.


    3. document.write: This is used to display the output of the JS code on the webpage itself.
                     The output can even be displayed in the form of HTML elements.

    4. innerHTML: This method displayes our output in a particular HTML element.
                    It also supports the HTML tags in the output.,
    


    Effects of <script> tag placement:

        1. In the head section: The JS code in the script tag will start its execution before HTML elements are loaded.
                                Due to this, if we want to work with any HTML element, we won't be able to do it and will get error.
                                It there is any code in this script tag which is lengthy and might take time, it will affect the performance of our page. 
                                The page will be displayed properly only after that code is finished
        2. At the end of body section: When the script tag is written in the end of body section, it will get the necessary 
                                HTML elements for its operation.
                                If there is any lengthy code in this script tag, it won't hamper the performance of the HTML page.
