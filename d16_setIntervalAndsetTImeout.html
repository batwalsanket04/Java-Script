    Asynchronous Behaviour of JS:

    JS is a single threaded language and thets why is works in Synchronous manner.
    It means that the code will get executed lnie by line from top to the bottom.
    In this case the functions which take time to execute makes others functions wait for their turn.
    To avoid this asynchronous behaviour is implemented.
    In asynchronous behaviour JS can hold or block any function can can take time and allow other 
    functions to perform their execution.

    Because of this the time taking functions can perform in their own time while the 
    other function carry out their work
    This asynchrnous behaviour can be implemented using:

    1. callbacks
    2. async and await
    3. promises
    4. setInterval
    5. setTimeout
    *****************************************************************************



    setInterval(callback, time_interval): 
    This method takes two arguments, i.e. a callback function and time interval in milliseconds
    It executes the given callback function repeatedly after the given interval.
    If their is any function performing its task, it will continue its work without being 
    interrupted by this ssetInterval.
    This is how the setINterval will perform its task asynchronously.

    To stop the execution of setInterval, we get a method called clearInterval()


    setTimeout(callback, time_interval):

    This method also takes two arguments, i.e. a callback function and time interval in milliseconds
    It will start the execution of the callback function after the given time interval.
    But it executes the callback function only once.
    after execution the setTimeout will stop.

      function greet() {
        let timeNow = new Date();
        console.log("Hello, the time is " + timeNow.toLocaleTimeString());
      }

      // greet();

      // let si1 = setInterval(greet, 2000);

      // let si2 = setInterval(() => {
      //   console.log("This is executed simultaneously");
      // }, 1000);

      // function stop() {
      //   clearInterval(si1);
      //   clearInterval(si2);
      // }
      let cnt = 0;
      let si1 = setInterval(() => {
        cnt++;
        console.log(cnt);
      }, 1000);

      // setTimeout(greet, 5000);

      setTimeout(() => {
        clearInterval(si1);
      }, 10000);
