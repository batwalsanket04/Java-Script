        BOM

        BOM stands for Browser Object Model
        It returns the browser in form of a javascript object
        Using this BOM we can work with our browser from the JS code.

        The BOM is represented using the keyword 'window'
        This is a global level object.
        It is present in our code everytime even if we particularly don't write it.
        Apart from 'window', 'this' is another global level object.


        Dialog boxes in BOM:

        1. alert

        2. prompt

        3. confirm


        Objects in BOM:

        1. history: It helps us to work with the history of the browser
                    back(): Goes one page behind in history
                    forward(): Goes one page ahead in the history
                    go(no_of_pages): Goes given no of pages forward or behind in the history
        2. location: It gives us information about different parts of URL

        3. navigator: This gives us information about the browser and the user environment (our device)

        4. screen: This returns all the information about the screen of the device.



        BOM methods:

        print(): It can print our webpage through JS code 
        open(link, target, features): It helps us to open a new page using JS code for buttons
        close(): This method helps us to close the pages which were opened using the open() method
    -->

    <button onclick="history.back()">Go Back</button>
    <button onclick="history.forward()">Go Forward</button>
    <button onclick="history.go(-2)">Go 2 Pages back</button>
    <hr />
    <button onclick="window.print()">Print Page</button>
    <button
      onclick="window.open('./d15_childPage.html', '_blank', 'width= 800, height= 600')"
    >
      Open Child Page
    </button>

    <script>
      console.log(window);
      //   window.alert("This is from alert");
      //   alert("This is from alert");
      //   window.prompt("How is your day going?");
      //   prompt("How is your day going?");
      //   window.confirm("Are you good?");
      //   confirm("Are you good?");

      console.log(window.history);
      console.log(window.navigator);

      console.log(window.screen);
