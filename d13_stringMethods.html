    String in-built methods

    length: It returns the count of characters in the string.

    slice(strating_index, ending_index): It extracts a portion of string from the starting index 
                    till before ending index. It supports the negative indices.

    substring(straing_index, ending_index): It extracts a portion of string stating from the 
                    given starting index till before the ending index. It does not support negative indices.
                    The output with negative index positions is illogical.

    substr(starting index, no of characters): This method also returns the extracted portion from a string, 
                    but it takes the starting index and the no of characters as the arguments.

    touppercase() and toLowercase(): Converts our string into capital letters or small letters

    concat(): This method concatenates strings together.

    indexOf(): It returns the index position of first occurence of the given character

    lastIndexof(): It returns the index position of last occurence of the given character.

**The above two methods will return -1 in case the element is found in the given string. This is because
the string has positive index positions starting from 0. If the return is negative, that means no such index
position is present and it symbolizes that the element is not present in string



    split('separator character'): This method divides our string into array elements from 
                 the given separator character.

    trim()/trimStart()/trimEnd(): These methods helps us to remove the whitespace from 
                the starting or ending of the string

    includes(): It check whether the given character/string is present in the string or not.
                It is case sensitive.

    replace(): This method replaces the first occurence of the given character/string with 
               the replacement string/character.

    pad()/padStart()/padEnd(): These methods increase the length of the string to the desired 
               length by adding some character to start or end of the string.
