    <!-- Object:
          -it is one of the most fundamental concept in jS.
          Object are the entities which sre used to store very large amount of data.
          they have no limitation on the data storage i.e we can store any amount and kind of data in them.
          the data store within an object is individually indentified by refering to its 'key'
          this called as key indexing.


    way to create Object 

    1.literal method:-
                    -we simply create a variable and store an object in the variable.
                    -this method is useful to create the standalone Object.

    2.instance method ( can be used for other datatype as well):-
                      -This method is use to create an object using "new " keyword and then store the data in the object.
                      -This method can be used on other datatypes as well as create their object.

    3.constructor method:-
                       -in this we use a constructor to create multiple objects of similar type.
                       constructore is a special type of function which is used to initialize value to an objects
                     -this constructor is useful when we want to create multiple instances of same object type.
