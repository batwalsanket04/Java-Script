    Ways to write functions is JS

    1. Named function/Normal function: 
            This is the most common way to write a function.
            We write a function using 'function' keyword and we call it using the name assigned to the function.
            The named functions are hoisted, i.e. they can be called even before declaring them.

    
    2. Variable named function/Variable expressions:
            In this type, we crate a normal function and store it in a variable
            For calling this function, we need to call the variable. If we call the stored function, it gives error
            The variable named functions are not hoisted.


    3. Anonymous functions:
            It is somewhat similar to a variable named function, only the difference is that the function 
            stored in the variable does not have any name.
            For calling this function, we need to call the variable in which the function is stored.
            This type is commonly used in callback functions.


    4. Self invoking functions:
            This is a type of function which calls itself automatically after it is declared.
            It is written like an anonymous function but it is written in '( )' without storing in any variable
            This type of functions are used to perform some action as soon as the page is loaded.

    5. Arrow functions(Fat arrow/Lambda):
            It is a function from ModernJS(ES6)
            It replaces various types of functions especially anonymous functions.
            This type is very commonly used in callback functions.
            It does not involve writing the function keyword, instead, it directly uses the '()', '=>' and '{}'
            Rules for writing the '{}' in arrow function:
            1. It does not need '{}' if the code block is of one line.
            2. If the code is of multiple lines or if the single code has return keyword, then the '{}' are mandatory

    <script>
      // Named function/Normal function
      function demo() {
        console.log("This is printed using Normal Function");
      }
      demo();

      //   Variable named function/Variable expression

      var myFunction = function demo1() {
        console.log("This is printed in Variable named function");
      };

      //   demo1(); //Gives error
      myFunction();

      //   Anonymous function

      let myFunction2 = function () {
        console.log(`This is printed using Anonymous function`);
      };

      myFunction2();

      //   Self invoking function

      (function () {
        console.log("This is printed from self invoking function");
      })();

      //   Arrow function

      //   The below function does not need '{}' because the code block is of single line.
      //   let myFunction3 = () =>
      //     console.log("This is printed using arrow function");

      //If the code is multilined, { } are mandatory

      //   let myFunction3 = () => {
      //     console.log("This is first line");
      //     console.log("This is second line");
      //   };

      //IF the code is single-lined but has return keyword, the '{}' are mandatory
      let myFunction3 = () => {
        return "Hello";
      };
      //   myFunction3();

      console.log(myFunction3());
