Q.What is Scripting languages..?
Ans:-Scripting is type of programming languages only.
    -The regular programming language get compipled first and then get executed.
    -the scripting lang get compiled at the time of execution itself and then get executed.
    - hence the scriptinmg lang. are slower  for compared to the programming lang.
    -java script such as scripted lang. which gets interpreted by a translator in the browser while executing itself.

1.about js

Q.features of js.?

ans:-Structured programming like c.
    -weakly/dynamically /losely types language.
    -light weighted and interpreted lang.
    -case sensitive
    -plateform independenat
    -provides good controll to users over the web browser.


Q.Java And javascript

 java:-
      - it is class based lang.
      -multithreaded lang.
      -consumes more memory
      -it is a class based  lang
      -it is compiled programming lang.
      -used to build standalone or enterprise level application.

javaScript:-

       -it is event driven lang 
       -single threaded lang
       -consume less memory
       it is as objext based lang
       -it is interpreted scripting lang
       -used to build interactive website,web application and mobile application.

appilications developes by using javasript:-

  1.amazon
  2.Flipcart
  3.Uber
  4.Netflix
  5.Dualingo
  6.AngryBird
  7.LikedIn
  8.VS Code


3.uses of js:-
            -client side Scripting.
            -displaying popups and dialog boxes.
            -dynamic dropdown menus.
            -displaying time and date
            -displaying clocks


4.dis-advantages js:-
              -Security as the code can be viewed in the console.
              -Old browser do not support javascript.
              -javascript works on single inheritance only.
              -one line of error can cause problem in the entire flow of program.
              
Q.history of js.?
ans:-it was invented by Brenden Eich in 1995
    - it was developed in just 10 days.
    -it was developed by notscape communication for their new browser.
    -it was initially called mocha which later become live script and then was called java script.
    - due to a conflict with similar scripting lang. by microsoft .this lang was handed over to ECMA which standerdized it
     and it was then called as ECMA script (ES).
6.way to write js:-
                 i.External js:- It is type of javascript which is written in  a saperate file
                                 having .js extension and connected to the HTML doc using Script tag.

                 ii.Internal Js:- When we write the js code in the code HTML document using Scripttag  it is called internal Js.

                 iii. inline js:-when the js code is written in the body of the openining tag of any element, its called as inline js.

7:-Where we can write the js code:-

                 1.ON Vs Code:-js code written in the vs code in new file when we want to code as functionality and make it permanant.
                 2.on console of any browser:- when we want to use temporarly code. 

8.Statement and comment:-

  statement:-A statement is an instruction given to the computer. 
             -It is how programming languages in general work, not just JavaScript, but all programming languages.

  comment:-Comments are like notes to yourself or other programmers in the programming languages. 
          -It is good practice to keep comments in your code.



  1.single line comment:-(//)

  2.multiline commennt:-(/*   */)


9.output posibilities:
                
                1.console.log:-
                 -Its is use to display of output in the console of the browser.

                2.document.write:-
                 -this is used to display the output of the js code on the webpage itself.
                 -the output can  be even displayed in the form of html elements.

                3.alert:
                -IT will be displayed on the browser with the help of alert formalt.
                -it does not requires us to open the console like in previous method
                -the Dis adv.for alert is that is halts the execution of the program untill the confirmation of alert.


                4.inner HTMl:-
                this mnethod displyes our output in a perticuler  html element.
                it also support html tag in the output.

10.Effects of Script tag plaement:-

                1.in the head  section:- the js code in the script tag will starts its execution before html element are loaded.
                                        due to 

               2.at the end of the body section:-
              
11.what is variable in js:-
  
  - variables are the container which are used to store some data which can be later used for processing.
  -variable made of two thing.

  ex. var(declarator) n1(identifire)=100( data);

  1.identifire:-

  - the identifire is the name given to variable which can be used for uniquely identify the given variable.

  -rules of identifire:-

   1.the name of the variable should not be any reserved keyword (if.while ,let,for,new,do, const etc..)
   2.the name of the varible should not contain any space.
   3.instead of spaces we can use "PascleCasing" "camelCasing"
   4.we cannot use any other symbol than "$","_" is allowd only .
   5.we can not used varibale name as number at the starting.
   6.-also we cant start the varible as number.

  2.declarator:
   
  -it defines the scope of the varible in the code.
  -thus are the keyword which specify the scope of any variable.
  -scope is the area of the variable should be applicated.
  -if the scope is improperly defined then the variable get access to the other part of code it can couse issues.

    
  -we get three declarator as follow
   1.var:-
           -this is declarator from older js.
           -this  is global scope declarator.
            -it can  be redeclared and reassigned.
   2.let:-
            -it is feature from ES6 (2015)
            -it is block scope declarator
            -this is not allows to redeclare but it allows to re-assign.
   3.const:-
           -feature of modern js (ES6)
           -it is also used for creating a block scope declaretor.



* Hoisting //imp IQ

 hoisting:- iS THE defoult behaviour of js.
            it allows use to declare our variable later on after initializing using it first.
            -when we declare outr variable after initializing and use  ,js internally takes variable to the top of the code.

            -at time ,the behaviour can also forget declarating the variable due to hosting  behaviour of js.
            -this can create problem in the execution and troubleshooting of the js code.
