     Extra Arguments:-

     In javaScript ,the arguments that we pass to a function are stored in collection.
     from this collection only those numbers of arguments are used as the number of parameters .
     but that does not mean that we have to pass only that much argumnets as the parameters.
     javascript allows us to pass more arguments than the parameters without giving a any error.
     these extra arguments can be used /handled by the concept of rest parameters.

     In rest parameters ,all the extra arguments are stored in a collection which can later be used for any desired perpose.
     for this,we use rest operator.

     Rest(....parametername) operator is a modern JS operator(ES6)
     it collects all the individual elements and stores then which a collection.
     we can then use this collection for our required purpose.
