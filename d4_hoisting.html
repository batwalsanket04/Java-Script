    Hoisting:

    It is the default behaviour of Javascript
    It allows us to declare our variable later on after intializing and using it first.
    When we declare our variable after intialization and use, Javascript internally takes 
    the variable to the top of the code.

    Because of this, the variable comes in the original flow of the variable lifecycle and 
    thus gets executed properly

    At times, the developer can also forget declaring the variable due to the 
    hoisting behaviour of Javascript.
    This can create problems in the execution and troubleshooting of the JS code.
    
    The concept of declaration is only applicable on var.

    let and const do not support hoisting.
    -->
    <script>
      // Normal flow of variable

      //   Intialize
      num1 = 35;

      //   Use
      console.log(num1);

      //   Declare
      var num1;

      //   Lets try hoisting on the let and const

      num2 = 40;
      console.log(num2);

      //   let num2;        //This is not supported. We will get error on the console.
      /*

      Const does not support hoisting because it has to declared and assigned at the same time.
      Since we cannot intialize const declarator separately, it cannot be hoisted.


      const num3
      ;num3= 101;
      */
